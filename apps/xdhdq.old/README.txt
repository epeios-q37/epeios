NOTA for the maintainer : this is the app's root README, for all the app,
bot the one dedicated to this sub-component.

'xdhdq' is an application which has been developed as proof of concept of the
'XDHTML' technology.
'xdhdq' is based on the Epeios framework and written by Claude SIMON
(http://q37.info/contact/).

'xdhdq' comes with different components. Each component has its own copy of the
Epeios framework in 'src/epeios' (not the entire framework ; only the modules
it needs).

The 'tools' directory contains the general tools (i.e. not dedicated to
'xdhdq') needed to launch 'xdhdq'. The 'frontend' directory contains the
frontend part (user interface) of 'xdhdq'.

Unlike other Epeios framework related applications, there is no 'processing'
directory (which usually contains the processing tools and the backend),
because this application focuses on the 'XDHTML' technology, which only deals
 with user interfaces.
Also, although this appllication has no backend, there are some backend-related
files, such as 'frdapi.h'. This file acts only as placeholder and facilitates
the coding. 

There is another 'CHANGELOG' file in 'src/epeios' directories, which concerns
the Epeios framework. As the application is based on the Epeios framework, some
entries may also concern this application.
