'orgnzq' is ... based on the Epeios framework and written by Claude SIMON (http://q37.info/contact/).

'orgnzq' comes with different components. Each component has its own copy of the Epeios framework in
'src/epeios' (not the entire framework ; only the modules it needs). Also each component comes which
is own documentation, in the 'doc' subdirectory.

The 'tools' directory contains the general tools (i.e. not dedicated to 'orgnzq') needed
to launch 'orgnzq'.
The 'frontend' directory contains the frontend part (user interface) of 'orgnzq'.
The 'processing' directory with the processing tools and the backend of 'orgnzq'.

There is another 'CHANGELOG' file in 'src/epeios' directories, which concerns the Epeios framework.
As the application is based on the Epeios framework, some entries may also concern this appkcation.
