The Meta Mail User Agent ('MMUAq') is an application which allows to handle
several mail account as a global one. It is based on the Epeios framework and
written by Claude SIMON (http://q37.info/contact/).

'MMUAq' comes with different components. Each component has its own copy of the
Epeios framework in 'src/epeios' (not the entire framework ; only the modules
it needs).

The 'frontend' directory contains the frontend part (user interface) of 'MMUAq'.
The 'processing' directory with the processing tools and the backend of 'MMUAq'.

There is another 'CHANGELOG' file in 'src/epeios' directories, which concerns
the Epeios framework. As the application is based on the Epeios framework, some
entries may also concern this application.
