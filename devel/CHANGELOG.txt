Meaning of list markers (2nd level):

2015-03-15 :
- CSDLES :
	* Adaptation to changes  in 'ERR'.
- ERR :
	* Removing all réference to 'CIO'. The final error handling had to be handled upstream (through the modified 'ERRFEpilog()' macro).
- MTK :
	* A uncaught exception will now terminate the program. All exceptions shoud be caught dowstream.
- SCLDAEMON :
	- Removing 'DisplayModuleClos(ing|ed)Message()' functions, to remove reference to 'CIO' (unavailable when the daemon is embedded).
- SCLMISC :
	* Removing all dependences to 'CIO'.
	* Hence, moving 'text_oflow_rack___' to 'SCLTOOL'.
- SCLTOOL :
	* Due to changes in 'ERR', the final error message printing is now supplied by this module.
	* As one of the few (or the only one) to use the 'CIO' module, retrieving 'text_oflow_rack___' from 'SCLMISC'.
	* Removing forgotten bug tracking feature.

2015-03-14 :
- CSDLEO :
	* No more 'C(Out|Err)' in the shared data, as the error handling object are now shared with the dynamic libraries.
- CSDLES :
	* Adaptation to changes to 'CSDLEO'.
	* The errors are no more intercepted, but passed from the dynamic library to the calling code.
- FLX :
	* : For the 'void' drivers, by default (can be changed on initialization), an access to it launch an error.

2015-03-13 :
- GLOBAL :
	* Adaptation to changes in 'UYS'.
- FNM :
	* Handling the 'NULL' case fot 'Type_(...)' function.'
- NTVSTR :
	* Change made the 11th active only for Windows, as g++ complains about.
- TOL :
	* Introducing 'E_XENUM', which simplifies error handling with 'enum's.
- UYS :

	- Renaming 'file_manager___' to 'file_hook___'
	* Introducing 'hook_filnames___'.

2015-03-12 :
- SCLPLUGIN
	* Removing test feature.

2015-03-11 :

		- 'directory' ('dir' in short) for a directory,
		- 'filename' for a file name, with or without its location,
		- 'basename' for a file name without its location, but with its extension,
		- 'location' for the location (the list of the parent directories) of a file,
		- 'affix' the 'basename' of a file without its extension.
- NTVSTR :
	* Adding method for int, to avoid to have to cast NULL (defined as '0') into '(const ntvstr::char__ *)'.
