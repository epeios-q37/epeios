CHANGELOG FOR THE EPEIOS FRAMEWORK.

Meaning of list markers (2nd level):
- '-' : Cosmetic changes. Function/method and/or parameter name changes.
	    Also changes for adaptation to changes of a module, resulting in adding or changing the type of parameters,
		in a broad sense (parameters of a fucntion, a method, or a template...).
		Functionnalities (should) remain unchanged.
- '*' : Functionnality changes.
- '%' : API changes (is superseded by functionnality changes).
- '#' : Bug fixing.

2015-03-21 :
- CSDLEO :
	% Adding a '[CSDLEO]Initialize(...)' method to relieve the C API (for the same reason as belove).
- PLGNCORE, PLNG, SCLPLUGIN
	% Because the C functions exposed by a dynamic library don't allow interruptions, to simplify error handling,
	  the API of a dynamic library will be exposed through a (C++) callback (execpt, of course, the function
	  which provides this callback).
- SCLDAEMON :
	- Adaptation to changes in 'CSDLEO'.


2015-03-20 :
- SCLMISC, SCLRGSTRY :
	% Adding plugin features, as a standard way to retrieve a plugin reference from a configuration file.


2015-03-19
- XHTCLLBK :
	- Adding the label of the action corresponding to the closing of a program.
- SCLXHTML :
	- '[_]prelaunch_callback__' becomes '[_]action_helper_callback__'
	% On above call, adding '...OnClose(...)'.
	- '...Prelaunch(...)' becomes '...OnBeforeAction(...)'.


2015-03-16 :
- CTN, IAS, LST, LSTBCH, LSTCTN :
	- Adaptation to changes in 'UYS'.
- CSDBNS :
	* Adaptation to changes in 'ERR'. Errors are no more intercepted, so the program is terminated when a error occurs.
	  Not really happy about this behavior, but the errors should be intercepted downstream.
- FLX :
	* In 'void _(i|o)flow_driver___', 'Commit()' and 'Dismiss()' are always allowed, as they are automatically called
	  when the object is deleted.
	% Use of 'access__' instead of a boolean.
- FRDKRN :
	* Adaptation to changes in 'CSDLEO'.
- SCLBACKND :
	- Adaptation to changes in 'FLX'.
- SCLRGSTRY :
	# : 'GetUnsigneNumber(...)' returns now the correct value.
	- : Modifying 'GetSigneNumber_(...)' to take account of changes in 'STR'.
- SCLTOOL :
	* Retrieving signal handling from 'TOL'.
- STR :
	% : Some signed 'ToNumber' functions took limits parameters before the value to retrieve ; this is now modified to be
	    coherent with similar functions.
- SCLTOOL :
	- Adaptation to changes in 'FLX'.
- SCLXHTML :
	* Adaptation to changes to 'ERR'.
	* The errors are no more intercepted, but passed to the calling code.
	* Removing references to 'CIO'.
- TOL :
	* Moving signal handling to 'SCLTOOL'.
- UYS :
	- Introducing 'mode__' to use instead 'fil::mode__'.
	- Introducing 'behavior' to use instead of a boolean.


2015-03-15 :
- CSDLES :
	* Adaptation to changes in 'ERR'.
- ERR :
	* Removing all réference to 'CIO'. The final error handling had to be handled upstream (through the modified 'ERRFEpilog()' macro).
- MTK :
	* A uncaught exception will now terminate the program. All exceptions shoud be caught dowstream.
- SCLDAEMON :
	- Removing 'DisplayModuleClos(ing|ed)Message()' functions, to remove reference to 'CIO' (unavailable when the daemon is embedded).
- SCLMISC :
	* Removing all dependences to 'CIO'.
	* Hence, moving 'text_oflow_rack___' to 'SCLTOOL'.
- SCLTOOL :
	* Due to changes in 'ERR', the final error message printing is now supplied by this module.
	* As one of the few (or the only one) to use the 'CIO' module, retrieving 'text_oflow_rack___' from 'SCLMISC'.
	* Removing forgotten bug tracking feature.


2015-03-14 :
- CSDLEO :
	* No more 'C(Out|Err)' in the shared data, as the error handling object are now shared with the dynamic libraries.
- CSDLES :
	* Adaptation to changes to 'CSDLEO'.
	* The errors are no more intercepted, but passed from the dynamic library to the calling code.
- FLX :
	* : For the 'void' drivers, by default (can be changed on initialization), an access to it launch an error.


2015-03-13 :
- GLOBAL :
	* Adaptation to changes in 'UYS'.
- FNM :
	* Handling the 'NULL' case fot 'Type_(...)' function.'
- NTVSTR :
	* Change made the 11th active only for Windows, as g++ complains about.
- TOL :
	* Introducing 'E_XENUM', which simplifies error handling with 'enum's.
- UYS :
	* Using the new 'E_XENUM' from 'TOL'.
	- Renaming 'file_manager___' to 'file_hook___'
	* Introducing 'hook_filnames___'.


2015-03-12 :
- SCLPLUGIN
	* Removing test feature.


2015-03-11 :
- GLOBAL :
	- Généralization of the use of the terms :
		- 'path' for, in a generic way, a file or a directory.
		- 'directory' ('dir' in short) for a directory,
		- 'filename' for a file name, with or without its location,
		- 'basename' for a file name without its location, but with its extension,
		- 'location' for the location (the list of the parent directories) of a file,
		- 'affix' the 'basename' of a file without its extension.
- NTVSTR :
	* Adding method for int, to avoid to have to cast NULL (defined as '0') into '(const ntvstr::char__ *)'.
