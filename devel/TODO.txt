TODO for the 'Epeios' framework.

- XDHTML
	- Implementing data filling in a second pass through a 'data-xdh' attribute (like event and cast handling); should fix Mozilla issue.
- 'CSDL...' : Reimplementation ; has no more to do with embedded library.
- 'SCL...' : Renaming ('SCLxyyy...' to 'SCLx').
- 'XPP' : Réimplement in a simplified manner.
- Reimplement log handling ('LOG' library) to put is as part of 'SCLMISC' (depends if it's a file log or a console log).
- Adaptation of the network related libraries to IPv6.
- Implementing 'XDHTML' technology under 'Gecko' (without 'XUL' ; only 'HTML 5'). There are more platforms for 'Gecko' than for 'CEF', as,
  for 'Gecko', if there is no 'XULRunner', there will be 'Firefox' (check if the '--app' option is always available for 'Firefox').
  Furthermore, things as a file explorer are available under 'Gecko' and needs no to be reimplelmented as with 'CEF'.
- Implementing the number conversion from the 'STR' library in another library based on a flow as input.

IN PROGRESS :
- Implementing flow variations (TXF, XTF, FLX libraries) to take a driver, not a flow ; the needed flow will be instantiated internally.

SUSPENDED :
- XDHTML
	- Implementation for Android.
	
MADE :
2016-09-24 :
- Adding detection of 'crate' using as list without being a list (use of 'CRT' instead of 'LSTCRT' ; accessing a 'CRT' item with 'qNIL' row).

2016-09-02 :
- Fixing errors occuring when compiling using WSL (Widows Subsystem for Linux).

2016-08-22 :
- Fixing erros which occurs in backends on regular deconnection from frontend.
