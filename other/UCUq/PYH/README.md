# Microcontrolers unleashed!

This project, together with the related documentation, including this file, is currently under development.

Prototype your microcontroller project easily by controlling it remotely with *Python*.

Install *MicroPython* on your microcontroller and place the files in the *device* directory there, adapting the contents of the *ucuq.json* file beforehand. You'll then be able to control your microcontroller remotely with *Python*, even from a web browser. No need to transfer dedicated software for each new component connected to your microcontroller.
