# README for the programming workshop

The `main.py` and `starter/py` is mainly to use with *repl.it*.

To launch an exercise: `python (de|en|fr)/(A|B|C).py`. For example: `python fr/B.py`.

The `workshop/assets` directory contains files used for the exercises. The `ab` sub-directory is for exercises *A* and *B*, the `c` sub-directory for the `C` exercise, and the `z` sub-directory for the *Z* exercise (for *fr* only).

The content of the `Body.html` will be put in the *body* section of the HTML main page, and the content of the `Head.html` file will be put in the *head* section of the same page. The CSS rules are usually put in the latter file.
