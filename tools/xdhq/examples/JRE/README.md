# *Atlas* demonstration applications for *Java*

There is also a version for:
  * *Node.js* : <http://github.com/epeios-q37/atlas-node-demo/>,
  * *PHP* : <http://github.com/epeios-q37/atlas-php-demo/>.


## Running:

(*Work in progress*)
  
Except under *Windows*, you will need a *C++* compiler for the installation to succeed.

## Misc.

For minimal *Atlas* application demonstration, instead of `java Notes` in the `Notes`directory, launch `java Blank` in the `Blank`.

Modifying the content of the `blank` directory is a good way to create your own *Atlas* based application.

For more information on *Atlas*, see <http://atlastk/>.
