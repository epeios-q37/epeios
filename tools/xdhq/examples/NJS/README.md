# *UnJSq* demonstration applications for *Node.js*.

  * Retrieve this repository,
  * open a terminal and go to the root directory of the retrieved repository,
  * launch `npm init -y` (or create you own `package.json`),  
  * launch `npm install unjsq` (except under *Windows*, you will need a *C++* compiler),
  * launch `node notes/main.js`,
  * open in a web browser <http://localhost:8080/>.
  
For minimal *UnJSq* application demonstration, instead of `node notes/main.js`, launch `node blank/main.js`.

Modifying the content of the `blank` directory is an easy way to create your own *UnJSq* application.

For more information on *UnJSq*, see <http://q37.info/UnJSq/>.
