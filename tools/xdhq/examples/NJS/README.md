# *UnJSq* demonstration applications for *Node.js*.

Running:
  * Retrieve this repository,
  * launch `npm install`,
  * launch `node notes/main.js`,
  * open <http://localhost:8080/> in a web browser.
  
Except under *Windows*, you will need a *C++* compiler for the installation to succeed.

For minimal *UnJSq* application demonstration, instead of `node notes/main.js`, launch `node blank/main.js`.

Modifying the content of the `blank` directory is a good way to create your own *UnJSq* based application.

For more information on *UnJSq*, see <http://q37.info/UnJSq/>.
