# *UnJSq* demonstration applications for *Node.js*.

  * Retrieve this repository,
  * launch, from the root directory of the repository, `npm install unjsq` (except under *Windows*, you will need a *C++* compiler),
  * launch, from the same, directory `node notes/main.js`,
  * open in a web browser <http://localhost:8080/>.
  
For minimal *UnJSq* application demonstration, instead of `node notes/main.js`, launch `node blank/main.js`.

Modifying the content of the `blank` directory is an easy way to create your own *UnJSq* application.

For more information on *UnJSq*, see <http://q37.info/UnJSq>.
