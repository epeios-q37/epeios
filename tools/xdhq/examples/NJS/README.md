# *UnJSq* demonstration applications for *Node.js*

There is also a version for:
  * *Java* : <http://github.com/epeios-q37/unjsq-demos-java/>,
  * *PHP* : <http://github.com/epeios-q37/unjsq-demos-php/>.

## Running:
* Retrieve this repository,
* launch `npm install`,
* launch `node notes/main.js`,
* open <http://localhost:8080/> in a web browser.
  
Except under *Windows*, you will need a *C++* compiler for the installation to succeed.

## Misc.

For minimal *UnJSq* application demonstration, instead of `node notes/main.js`, launch `node blank/main.js`.

Modifying the content of the `blank` directory is a good way to create your own *UnJSq* based application.

For more information on *UnJSq*, see <http://q37.info/UnJSq/>.
