![PHP logo](https://q37.info/download/assets/PHP.png "PHP")

The *blank* application does almost nothing, and is intended as a basis for your own applications. The *notes* application is a more complex example which shows how to use widgets like [*CKEditor*](http://ckeditor.com/) with the *Atlas* toolkit.

Online demonstration:

  - of the *blank* application: <http://q37.info/runkit/Blank>,
  - of the *notes* application: <http://q37.info/runkit/Notes>.

To install and run these applications on your computer:

- get this repository (with *git*: `git clone https://github.com/epeios-q37/atlas-php-demo`),
- put, inside of the retrieved repository, the `Atlas.phar` file: https://q37.info/download/assets/Atlas.phar,
- for the *blank* demonstration, launch, from same directory, `php blank/main.php`,
- for the *notes* demonstration, launch, from same directory, `php notes/main.php`,

NOTA: **You need *PHP* with [*pthreads*](http://php.net/manual/book.pthreads.php)!**


There is also a version for:
  * *Node.js* : <http://github.com/epeios-q37/atlas-node-demo/>,
  * *Java* : <http://github.com/epeios-q37/atlas-java-demo/>.
