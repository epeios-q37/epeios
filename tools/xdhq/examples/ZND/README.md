# *Atlas* demonstration applications for *PHP*

## Running:

(*Work in progress*)
  
Except under *Windows*, you will need a *C++* compiler for the installation to succeed.

## Misc.

For minimal *Atlas* application demonstration, instead of `php notes/main.js`, launch `php blank/main.js`.

Modifying the content of the `blank` directory is a good way to create your own *Atlas* based application.
