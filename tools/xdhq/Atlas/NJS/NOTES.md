# Developers/maintainers notes about the *Atlas* toolkit binding for *Node.js*

## New packages

Currently, the new packaging is being developed for the *Node.js* binding. It will later be developed for the other bindings.

As the core of the *Atlas* toolkit is written *C/C++*, and the package manager for the different language (*NPM* for *Node.js*, *Composer* for *PHP*...) aren't designed to deploy native code, the installation process is somewhat cumbersome.

To allow those who are interested to fiddle with the *Atlas* toolkit, all the native component are on a server, and only components written in the language of the binding, an d hence easily installable with the package manager for this language, is locally installed.

This default installation can also be used for prototyping, for demonstrating a application to remote client, to ameliorate an application. The core of the application is executed locally, so no need to upload the source code to a remote server.

This default installation is not fitted for production, for which a full installation will be preferred. The desktop version also need the full installation.

To the currently available value for the command-line argument (`web`, `desktop`, `none` and corresponding shortcuts `w`, `d`, `n` and `wd` for both) can be prefixed with `P` to launch explicitly the *PROD* (production mode, which needs the full installation) or with `D` for the *DEMO* (demonstration) mode.

The developer's default mode id *PROD*, for all the others, it's *DEMO*.

*NOTA*:

* Following the installation of all *Atlas* toolkit bindings through *NPM*, the *xdhq* package was renamed to *xdhqnjs*,
* Because `require('atlas-node')` was to clumsy, the `atlas-node` package was renamed to `atlastk`,
* `xdhwebqnjs`was first `xdhwebq`.
