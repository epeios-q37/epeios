# CHANGELOG of the *msfgq* tool (all variants)

## 2023-10-12
- Setting duration on a note plays the note;
- the rest 'duration' inserts a rest and no more replaces the current note; the cursor stays on the rest, so the subsequent duration applies to the rest. 

## 2023-10-14
Adding a rest on the last note will put it after this note.
